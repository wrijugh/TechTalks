# Global Azure May 2022
Demo steps and commands 

## Same Nginx Image as WebApp used by kubectl
Nginx is a web app which can be used for demonstration purpose. 
```
docker.io/library/nginx
```
## Docker Steps
Below are the steps for local docker

### Check if docker is running by 

```docker ps```

If the above is not working and the error is 
```"Docker daemon is not running"```  then 
```
sudo service docker start
```

## To run the nginx 

```-d``` will ensure that it runs in the background. Becasue without it the nginx will hold the prompt. 

```
docker run -d docker.io/library/nginx
```

To confirm it is running use 

```
docker ps
```

To enter inside the running container, (to use name either give a proper name or use the name auto generated by docker. 

```
docker exec -it fc20b0420169 /bin/sh
```

Then in the tty run

```
curl http://localhost
```

If the page is showing then it is running inside the docker as a container. 

## Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Create the ACR via either portal or script. Portal is good for demo to clear the concept/ 

Then from local shell push it to Azure. Follow the below steps/

## Download the nginx image to local machine 

```
docker pull nginx
```
Then re-tag it based on the ACR. If the name of the ACR is 

```wgacr``` then tag it as ```wgacr.azurecr.io/nginx:latest```  

To verify if the image is available locally and note the image_id

```
docker images
```

Then tag it 

```
docker tag IMAGE_ID wgacr.azurecr.io/nginx:latest
```

---

## Push to ACR
First login to the ACR
```
docker login -u wgacr -p SuperSecret wgacr.azurecr.io
```

Push the image to ACR
```
docker push wgacr.azurecr.io/nginx:latest
```
---

## Azure Container Instance (ACI)

Create a new ACI pointing to the ACR we have uploaded the nginx to through Portal. Again showing it in Portal is best for demo. But actually we must automate it. 

From the overview of ACI get the public IP and open it in browser. You will see the landing page of Nginx. 

### Azure CLI (sample)

You may also login to the Shell for ACR 

```
az acr login -n wgacr
```

Below will create ACI but prompt for the registry username and password. 
```
az container create -g $g -n nginx420 --image=wgacr.azurecr.io/nginx --ip-address=Public 
```

To avoid that, you may pass two additional parameters

```
az container create -g $g -n nginx420 --image=wgacr.azurecr.io/nginx --ip-address=Public --registry-username=wgacr --registry-password=PASSWORD
```

## Azure App Service (Container)
To create a Azure App Service with container use portal. 


## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

### Create


### Deployment 
```
alias k=kubectl

k get nodes

k create deploy nginx --image=wgacr.azurecr.io/nginx:latest

k expose deploy nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer

k 

```

```

```
